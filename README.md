# moving-head-camera

Engineering degree's project for thesis name: Project of moving-head camera object tracking system.

There are two parts of this project. First is a moving-head camera device and second is an user endpoint.

This git repository is moving-head camera device which is responsible for rotating the camera. Implemented regulators are controlling speed and angular position.
Made by myself board is communicating with endpoint user device by UART.
